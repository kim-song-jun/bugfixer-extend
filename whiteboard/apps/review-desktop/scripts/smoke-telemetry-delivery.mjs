/**
 * Proves an error report survives the last leg: the durable queue on disk, the
 * flush, and the HTTP request to the analytics vendor.
 *
 *   node scripts/smoke-telemetry-delivery.mjs [--app <path to .app>] [--timeout-ms 120000]
 *
 * Why this is separate from smoke-error-telemetry.mjs. That one runs with
 * DEV_FAST_REVIEW_TELEMETRY_DEBUG=1, and the debug sink PRINTS events instead of
 * sending them. So it proves everything up to the sink and nothing after it: a
 * report could be shaped perfectly and still never leave, or leave with a
 * different payload than the sink displayed.
 *
 * This one sends for real, to a local endpoint standing in for the vendor
 * (PROGRESSIVE_REVIEW_POSTHOG_HOST), and asserts on the exact bytes of the
 * batch request. Nothing reaches the real project.
 *
 * What only this can catch: an event that the queue rejects as unserializable,
 * a property the transport drops on the way, a flush that never runs, and a
 * queue file that is never deleted after a successful send — which would mean
 * the same report is sent again on every launch, forever.
 *
 * Launches this checkout's dev build, or the packaged app named by `--app`.
 * Not part of `pnpm test` — it launches the application.
