/**
 * Closes and reopens the file tree beside a reviewed file.
 *
 * `Cmd+B` matches VS Code's Toggle Primary Side Bar, and it is taken here on
 * purpose. `ToggleSidebarVisibilityAction` in
 * `workbench/browser/actions/layoutActions.ts` claims the same chord at
 * `WorkbenchContrib`, and Review reaches that file transitively through
 * `workbench/browser/workbench.contribution.js`. At equal weight the last rule
 * registered wins, which is registration order rather than intent — so this asks
 * for one more than `WorkbenchContrib` to win deterministically.
 *
 * The binding carries no `when` clause on purpose, so the chord can never reach
 * the stock action. That action is not merely inert in Review: it flips
 * `partVisibility.sidebar`, toggles the layout class, and then calls
 * `setViewVisible` on `ReviewWorkbench.sideBarPartView`, which Review never
 * assigns. It throws with the layout state already half-changed. So this action
 * always takes the key and no-ops itself when there is no tree to toggle, rather
 * than declining the key and handing it to something that breaks the window.
