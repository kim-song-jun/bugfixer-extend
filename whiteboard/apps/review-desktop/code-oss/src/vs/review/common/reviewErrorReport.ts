 * Review server on the same machine. That server replaces the message with a
 * digest and keeps only the stack frames that resolve inside the shipped
 * bundle; see packages/review/src/error-telemetry.ts. Nothing in
 * this file is ever sent to a vendor as it stands.
 *
 * The filters mirror upstream `BaseErrorTelemetry._onErrorEvent`. They are
 * reimplemented rather than imported because that module pulls the whole file
 * service in behind it, and this one runs in the main process too.
